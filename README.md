# learn101

This repository contains all the information shared during my Learn 101 Challenge. Learn 101 is a challenge to keep the learning spirit going on and challenge myself to learn something daily for 101 Days, it can be anything from infosec to general life. Follow me on Twitter for Regular Updates: [@Sm4rty_](https://twitter.com/Sm4rty_). Huge thanks to [Harsh Bothra](https://twitter.com/harshbothra_) and [IWCON](https://iwcon.live/) from Where I got motivated to start this Learn101 challenge.
